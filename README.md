Project Overview
The InventoryApp was developed to meet the needs of small business owners and warehouse staff who require a simple and reliable way to manage their inventory. The main goal was to create a functional mobile app that allows users to securely log in or register, add and track inventory items, and receive optional SMS alerts for low stock. The app focuses on being user-friendly, with a clean interface and offline capabilities, ensuring that it works efficiently without requiring constant internet access.

Reflection
The app was designed to address key user needs such as quick and easy inventory entry, clear viewing of stock levels, and minimal setup requirements. Users in warehouse or fast-paced environments need tools that don't slow them down, so the app emphasizes speed, clarity, and optional SMS notifications without forcing extra steps. To support these needs, I developed several essential screens: a login and registration page, a main inventory display, an add item screen, and a prompt for SMS permissions. The UI design kept users in mind by ensuring readability, large buttons, and a consistent layout across devices, making interactions fast and intuitive. This approach proved successful because it reduced unnecessary complexity and allowed users to focus on their tasks.

My coding process was structured around breaking down the app into manageable components, starting with authentication, then handling inventory data, and finally integrating optional SMS functionality. I used modular coding techniques, careful commenting, and ensured compatibility with Android 8.0 and higher. These strategies helped maintain clean and organized code, which will be valuable in future projects by simplifying updates and debugging. Testing was done extensively on an Android emulator with API level 33, verifying that all functions performed as expected, from login to inventory updates. This testing process was important because it ensured the app’s reliability and helped identify minor layout adjustments needed for different screen sizes.

Throughout the design and development process, I encountered a key challenge in ensuring the app remained fully functional offline while still offering optional SMS features. I had to carefully structure the app’s logic to separate critical inventory tasks from network-dependent features. Overcoming this required thoughtful design around data storage and permission handling. One area where I felt I particularly demonstrated my skills was in the user interface design. I successfully created a responsive, intuitive layout that supports fast interaction and adapts well across devices, showcasing my ability to blend technical development with user-centered design principles.
